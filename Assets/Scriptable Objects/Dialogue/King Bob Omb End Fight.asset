    king????
  - You might be fast enough to ground me, but you'll have to pick up the pace if
    you want to take King Bowser by the tail.
  - Methinks my troops could learn a lesson from you! Here is your Star, as I promised,
    Mario.
  - If you want to see me again, select this Star from the menu. For now, farewell.
