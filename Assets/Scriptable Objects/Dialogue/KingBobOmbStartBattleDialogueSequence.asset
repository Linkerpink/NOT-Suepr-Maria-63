    over!
  - How dare you scale my mountain? By what right do you set foot on my imperial

  - ...and you'll never take away my Power Star. I hereby challenge you, Mario!
  - If you want the Star I hold, you must prove yourself in battle.
  - Can you pick me up from the back and hurl me to this royal turf? I think that
    you cannot!
